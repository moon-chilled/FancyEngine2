* Make a basic scene manager, with consumers and producers pushing things to screen/audio
 * Multithreading
* Finish support for scripting, at least with ecl and c/cffi, but maybe with others (d, perl6?)
* Add more assets (textures, 3d models, video maybe, custom/user-defined?)
* More sophisticated audio (3d/etc.)
