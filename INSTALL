Need:

- D compiler, C compiler
- git
- meson, ninja
- innoextract, 7-zip, wget (for dependencies)
- On unix: assimp, SDL, and OpenAL need to be in the system
- Note: if you build pathfinder from source, make sure to change the following definitions in c/src/lib.rs:
PF_GL_VERSION_GL3 = 1,
PF_GL_VERSION_GLES3 = 0,
PF_ARC_DIRECTION_CW = 1,
PF_ARC_DIRECTION_CCW = 0


Copy/symlink the 'dist' folder into any game.
